### Usage
StartPage is straightforward. Type into the text field to simply search google, or use `-` to indicate a macro. Macros on StartPage are 1 or 2 characters, and allow you to jump to a website or search its query.

An example search: `-y hello` will search youtube for "hello".

Macros can also be configured to jump a page of a website.

Example: `-4 wg` will go to 4chan.org/wg or `-r wallpapers` will go to reddit.com/r/wallpapers.

You can add or delete as many macros as you like.
You can also customize StartPage by changing the background image and the text field accent color.
